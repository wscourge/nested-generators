Description:
    Generates ServiceObject and its corresponding RSpec test file. Accepts
    scoped methods as arguments.

    IMPORTANT: On the first run, it also generates ApplicationService class
    file from which all further generated ServiceObjects inherit.

Usage:
    Pass the name of the ServiceObject, either CamelCased or under_scored, as
    the first argument along with an optional list of its scoped method names.

    For further instructions refer to the documentation at
    https://github.com/wscourge/nested-generators#serviceobject-generator

Examples:
    rails generate service cucumber

        In the app/services directory it creates a ServiceObject called
        "CucumberService" containing single public "call" method and the
        "ApplicationService" along with corresponding RSpec test file in the
        spec/services directory.

    rails generate service vegetables/tomato

        In the app/services/vegetables directory it creates a ServiceObject
        called "Vegetables::TomatoService" containing single public "call"
        method along with corresponding RSpec test file in the
        spec/services/vegetables.

    rails generate service swat public:nuke "protected:arm!" "private:ready?"
